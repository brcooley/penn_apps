Brainstorming
=============

generate vacation

pretend to be away
* pictures (with you ? tokbox; fileio?)
* trip information
* send texts? toivio
pretend to be home
* things to do while youre hiding?
* order in
* movie reccommendations from netflix and rotten tomatores



webpage with what is going to happen
* login with facebook / permissions
* approve vacation
* mongo db to store logins and vacations (for time delay)
* allow cancel vacations

Desired features for mongoDB to interface with on Facebook:
* status updates
* wall posts
* like our own pictures
* album creation & picture uploading
* keep track of every creation, both so that it can be retroactively deleted,
 and so that we can respond to comments or activity

* list of jobs, associated with timestamps for execution, with arguments (oauth tokens to jobs)
* allow cancel vacations


API
===
* masherly (hotwire)
* facebook
* mongoDB
* azure? (hosting)
* filepicker.io? tumblr? (get social pictues)
* twilio? (send fake texts; notify users about updates to their vacations)
* nytimes (what book are you reading?)
